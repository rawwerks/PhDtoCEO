# PhD to CEO

PhD to CEO is a book about metamorphosis by Raymond Weitekamp.

_This is currently a work in progress, hosted out in the open for a few reasons:_

* Accountability - it will be embarassing to leave this in a state of disrepair, but if I die tomorrow at least you'll have an outline
* Feedback - iteration is the name of the game
* Searchability - i hope others will learn as much from the process as the content
* Modularity

There are currently four Parts planned:

1. Taking the Leap
2. Solving Really Hard Problems
3. \(Inter\)Personal
4. Superpositions of Value
